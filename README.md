## About

This interactive browser game tracks your click responses and other metrics to study childrenâ€™s ability to follow an agentâ€™s gaze, using a continuous spatial layout. Moreover, you can decide whether to get recorded (via webcam) during the experiment. After completion, the app will automatically download two files: (1) a text file (JSON) containing responses, andâ€”if selected by the userâ€”(2) a video file (webm) of your webcam recording.Â¹

### Parameters

- German and English language support
- Optional webcam recording
- Gaming Modes: (1) a hedge version and (2) a box version. See here:

Â¹ Note that the Media Recorder API has a time scrubbing bug for chromium-based browsers (see here: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=569840). That means you cannot easily scrub through the recorded video. You can fix this by re-encoding the video. For example using Handbrake on macOS or ffmpeg (e.g., `ffmpeg -i video.webm -crf 24 -c:v libx264 video.mp4`), or any encoder of your choice.
